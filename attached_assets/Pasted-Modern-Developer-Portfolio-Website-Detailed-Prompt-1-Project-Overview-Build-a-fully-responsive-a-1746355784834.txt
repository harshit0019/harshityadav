Hey! I’m Harshit Yadav — part-time coder, full-time problem solver. I’m all about turning ideas into cool digital stuff 🌐💡.

Whether it’s tracking carbon footprints with Python + Streamlit, building slick dashboards in Power BI, or whipping up AI tools with ChatGPT & Replit, I’m in my zone when tech meets impact.

I’ve cooked up projects like a personal carbon tracker and an AI-powered SEO tag analyzer, and I’m currently leveling up as an Associate Programmer @ RMX Joss, where I build tools that actually do something — saving time, reducing emissions, and making data make sense.

Big fan of frontend design, a sucker for clean UI, and always experimenting with the latest in prompt engineering, Tailwind, and React. When I’m not coding, I’m gaming, vibing to lo-fi, or creating content just for fun 🎮🎨✨.

Let’s build something awesome together 🚀
